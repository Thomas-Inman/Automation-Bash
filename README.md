## NotesAutomation Folder

A quck disclaimer: I got this idea, and some of the code, from a youtuber named Kalle Hallden. Please check his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWr0mx597DnSGLFk1WfvSkQ) and [GitHub account](https://github.com/KalleHallden). The purpose of this program is to create a file, folder, and extension for a note.
